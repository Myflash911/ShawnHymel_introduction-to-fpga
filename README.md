# Introduction to FPGA

Welcome to the demo code and solutions section of my Introduction to FPGA course! This repository houses all of the example code and solutions that you may use as references when working through the FPGA examples.

[![Introduction to FPGA YouTube Series](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ShawnHymel/introduction-to-fpga/main/images/Intro%20to%20FPGA%20Part%201_Thumbnail.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLg1AgA2Xoo&list=PLEBQazB0HUyT1WmMONxRZn9NmQ_9CIKhb)

This course is hosted on YouTube that you may take for free. All you need to do is watch the videos and complete the challenge issued at the end of each video. I highly recommend you try each challenge before peeking at the solutions here.

The first video in the series is found here: [Introduction to FPGA Part 1 - What is an FPGA? | Digi-Key Electronics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLg1AgA2Xoo&list=PLEBQazB0HUyT1WmMONxRZn9NmQ_9CIKhb)

Written guides that explain the solutions can be found here: COMING SOON

## Directory Structure

Examples and solutions are housed in dirctories that correspond to each chapter or video number. For example, if you watch "Intro to FPGA Part 3 - Verilog Gate Logic," you should refer to the directory *03-verilog-gate-logic*.

In each directory, you will find example projects. Demonstrations used in the video are listed as *example-\** and the solution to that part's challenge is listed as *solution-\**.

The only exception to this is the *images* directory, which is where I keep images for this repository.
